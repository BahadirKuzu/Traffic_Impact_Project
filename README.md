# Traffic Impact Project

This repository contains the **Traffic Impact Study** conducted as part of the coursework for **CEE 5660: Transportation Planning** at **Tennessee Technological University**. The study evaluates the transportation impacts of a proposed mixed-use development and offers actionable recommendations to mitigate potential traffic issues.

## Project Overview
The study assesses the implications of a proposed development near Castle Drive, Jones Avenue, and Main Street. It integrates existing traffic data, forecasts future traffic volumes, and evaluates roadway capacity and safety to provide evidence-based solutions.

### Objectives
- Estimate **Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT)** using traffic counts and seasonal adjustment factors.
- Analyze **Peak-Hour Traffic Volumes** (AM and PM) and movement patterns.
- Calculate trip generation using the **ITE Trip Generation Manual**.
- Distribute traffic directionally based on **Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ)** populations.
- Combine existing and projected traffic volumes to assess roadway capacity requirements.
- Recommend mitigation strategies for capacity and safety improvements.

## Repository Structure
- **`/docs`**: Contains the final project report in PDF format.
- **`/data`**: Includes traffic data, seasonal adjustment calculations, and TAZ-related information.
- **`/figures`**: Visualizations such as charts and graphs representing key findings.
- **`/scripts`** *(optional)*: Placeholder for scripts or tools used in data processing or analysis.

## Key Findings
- The proposed development will significantly increase traffic volumes during peak hours.
- **PM peak-hour demand** exceeds roadway capacity, particularly at key intersections.
- Immediate mitigation measures such as **lane widening** and **signal optimization** are recommended.
- Long-term solutions include incorporating **multimodal infrastructure** and **transit enhancements**.
